                    Hello there, my name is Momchil Gorchev, im a bulgarian web developer living currently in London.
                    <br />
                    I am working in a technology company as a frontend developer and my daily routine includes dealing with all kind of development
                    and design work (I love that!). <br />
                    Sometimes im making websites, sometimes im enhancing user experiences and sometimes i do other stuff.
                    <br /><br />
                    Since i was a kid i loved to play with all forms of technologies and computers. Couple of years ago i have finished
                    some free computer science educational programs, (edX) offered by the biggest US Universities and that absolutely blow my mind
                    and made me live and breath programming and solving problems the computational way.
                    <br /><br />
                    I love to write quality, abstracted and reusable code and get inspired by other people who are doing that. My weapons of choice are
                    JavaScript and jQuery, PHP and MySQL, Python and of course HTML5 + CSS3 in form of SASS or LESS.
                    <br /> <br />
                    Im my spare time im trying to be a good father and husband, having a drink with my friends and play some video games.
                    I'm enjoying long walks, sunny weather, BBQs and superhero movies.
